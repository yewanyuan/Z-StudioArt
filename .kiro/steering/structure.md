## Structure Guidelines
To be defined as the project grows. Consider organizing by:
- Feature-based structure for larger applications
- Layer-based structure (models, views, controllers) for traditional architectures
- Component-based structure for frontend frameworks
- Module-based structure for libraries

## Conventions
To be established based on chosen technology stack and team preferences.
